Use EWMH

The element in the center must not be included, it will be forever 1\&.0 or changing based on opacity, depending on whether you have

\fB\-\-resize\-damage\fR \fIINTEGER\fR

Resize damaged region by a specific number of pixels\&. A positive value enlarges it while a negative one shrinks it\&. If the value is positive, those additional pixels will not be actually painted to screen, only used in blur calculation, and such\&. (Due to technical limitations, with
\fB\-\-dbe\fR
or
\fB\-\-glx\-swap\-method\fR, those pixels will still be incorrectly painted to screen\&.) Primarily used to fix the line corruption issues of blur, in which case you should use the blur radius value here (e\&.g\&. with a 3x3 kernel, you should use
\fB\-\-resize\-damage\fR
1, with a 5x5 one you use
\fB\-\-resize\-damage\fR
2, and so on)\&. May or may not work with

.SH "FORMAT OF CONDITIONS"
.sp
Some options accept a condition string to match certain windows\&. A condition string is formed by one or more conditions, joined by logical operators\&.
.sp
A condition with "exists" operator looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
With equals operator it looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
<NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE> <NEGATION> <OP QUALIFIER> <MATCH TYPE> = <PATTERN>
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
With greater\-than/less\-than operators it looks like:
.sp

.\}
.nf
<NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE> <NEGATION> <OPERATOR> <PATTERN>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fINEGATION\fR (optional) is one or more exclamation marks;
.sp
\fITARGET\fR is either a predefined target name, or the name of a window property to match\&. Supported predefined targets are id, x, y, x2 (x + widthb), y2, width, height, widthb (width + 2 * border), heightb, override_redirect, argb (whether the window has an ARGB visual), focused, wmwin (whether the window looks like a WM window, i\&.e\&. has no child window with WM_STATE and is not override\-redirected), client (ID of client window), window_type (window type in string), leader (ID of window leader), name, class_g (= WM_CLASS[1]), class_i (= WM_CLASS[0]), and role\&.
.sp
\fICLIENT/FRAME\fR is a single @ if the window attribute should be be looked up on client window, nothing if on frame window;
.sp
\fIINDEX\fR (optional) is the index number of the property to look up\&. For example, [2] means look at the third value in the property\&. Do not specify it for predefined targets\&.
.sp
\fIFORMAT\fR (optional) specifies the format of the property, 8, 16, or 32\&. On absence we use format X reports\&. Do not specify it for predefined or string targets\&.
.sp
\fITYPE\fR is a single character representing the type of the property to match for: c for \fICARDINAL\fR, a for \fIATOM\fR, w for \fIWINDOW\fR, d for \fIDRAWABLE\fR, s for \fISTRING\fR (and any other string types, such as \fIUTF8_STRING\fR)\&. Do not specify it for predefined targets\&.
.sp
\fIOP QUALIFIER\fR (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be ? (ignore\-case)\&.
.sp
\fIMATCH TYPE\fR (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be nothing (exact match), * (match anywhere), ^ (match from start), % (wildcard), or ~ (PCRE2 regular expression)\&.
.sp
\fIOPERATOR\fR is one of = (equals), <, >, <=, =>, or nothing (exists)\&. Exists operator checks whether a property exists on a window (but for predefined targets, exists means != 0 then)\&.
.sp
\fIPATTERN\fR is either an integer or a string enclosed by single or double quotes\&. Python\-3\-style escape sequences and raw string are supported in the string format\&.
.sp
Supported logical operators are && (and) and || (or)\&. && has higher precedence than ||, left\-to\-right associativity\&. Use parentheses to change precedence\&.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# If the window is focused
focused
focused = 1
# If the window is not override\-redirected
!override_redirect
override_redirect = false
override_redirect != true
override_redirect != 1
# If the window is a menu
window_type *= "menu"
_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE@:a *= "MENU"
# If the window name contains "Firefox", ignore case
name *?= "Firefox"
_NET_WM_NAME@:s *?= "Firefox"
# If the window name ends with "Firefox"

\fITARGET\fR is one of "n" (window name), "i" (window class instance), "g" (window general class), and "r" (window role)\&.
.sp
\fITYPE\fR is one of "e" (exact match), "a" (match anywhere), "s" (match from start), "w" (wildcard), and "p" (PCRE2 regular expressions, if compiled with the support)\&.
.sp
\fIFLAGS\fR could be a series of flags\&. Currently the only defined flag is "i" (ignore case)\&.
.sp
\fIPATTERN\fR is the actual pattern string\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
.sp
compton could read from a configuration file if libconfig support is compiled in\&. If \fB\-\-config\fR is not used, compton will seek for a configuration file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/compton\&.conf (~/\&.config/compton\&.conf, usually), then ~/\&.compton\&.conf, then compton\&.conf under $XDG_DATA_DIRS (often /etc/xdg/compton\&.conf)\&.
.sp
compton uses general libconfig configuration file format\&. A sample configuration file is available as compton\&.sample\&.conf in the source tree\&. Most commandline switches each could be replaced with an option in configuration file, thus documented above\&. Window\-type\-specific settings are exposed only in configuration file and has the following format:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
wintypes:
{
  WINDOW_TYPE = { fade = BOOL; shadow = BOOL; opacity = FLOAT; focus = BOOL; };
};

\fIWINDOW_TYPE\fR is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard: "unknown", "desktop", "dock", "toolbar", "menu", "utility", "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu", "popup_menu", "tooltip", "notify", "combo", and "dnd"\&. "fade" and "shadow" controls window\-type\-specific shadow and fade settings\&. "opacity" controls default opacity of the window type\&. "focus" controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered focused\&. (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on\&.)

.SH "D-BUS API"
.sp
It\(cqs possible to control compton via D\-Bus messages, by running compton with \fB\-\-dbus\fR and send messages to com\&.github\&.chjj\&.compton\&.<DISPLAY>\&. <DISPLAY> is the display used by compton, with all non\-alphanumeric characters transformed to underscores\&. For DISPLAY=:0\&.0 you should use com\&.github\&.chjj\&.compton\&._0_0, for example\&.
.sp
The D\-Bus methods and signals are not yet stable, thus undocumented right now\&.
